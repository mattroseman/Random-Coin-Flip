# Random-Coin-Flip
Uses the systems entropy pool to randomly flip a coin over and over again

This is a very simple python script that gathers random bits from the systems entropy pool located at /dev/random
and reads them in one at a time. 1 being head and 0 being tails.
This was done more to learn how the entropy pool worked, and how to access it.
